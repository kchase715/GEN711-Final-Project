# GEN711 Final Project
## Pond Microbiome Study

## Background
16s rRNA sequencing data was borrowed from a graduate student studying the microbiome composition of duckweeds.
The dataset includes:

- 40 paired-end FASTQ files from 20 samples (Illumina HiSeq 2500, 250 bp)
- Two pond sampling locations
- Two treatments:
  - Microbiome from duckweed skimmed off the pond surface
  - Microbiome from pond water
- 5 replicates per treatment
- A metadata file describing the samples
- A manifest file listing the FASTQ locations
  
- **Project Goal:** To analyze and compare the microbial community composition between duckweed and pond water samples.

### Data Source 
- Provided by a graduate student working on duckweed microbiomes
- Data Type: Paired-end 250 bp reads (FASTQ format)

### Analysis
- Conducted on RON remote cluster with `tmux` and `conda`
- Code was run in the `qiime2-amplicon-2024.5` and `qiime2-amplicon-2024.10` environments

### Tools Used

#### QIIME2
- Used for data import, demultiplexing, denoising with DADA2, taxonomic classification, and diversity analysis
- Imported FASTQ files using a manifest
- Denoised using `qiime dada2 denoise-paired`
- Generated feature table and representative sequences

#### Taxonomic Composition
- Trained classifier using SILVA reference database
  - Extracted 515F-806R region to match primers
- Ran taxonomy classification with `qiime feature-classifier classify-skylearn`
- Visualized using `qiime taxa barplot` at phylum level (Level 2)

#### q2-kmerizer + q2-boots
- Used to perform kmer-based diversity analysis (instead of building phylogenetic trees)
- Implemented via `qiime boots kmer-diversity`
- Calculated alpha and beta diversity metrics (e.g., Shannon, Evenness, Bray-Curtis)

#### Alpha Rarefaction
- Used `qiime diversity alpha-rarefaction` to assess species richness over sequencing depth
- Chose max-depth of 2500 based on frequency distribution

#### Differential Abundance
- Collapsed feature table to genus level
- Ran ANCOM-BC using `qiime composition ancombc`
- Compared duckweed vs. water samples for significantly enhanced or lacking genera

## Findings

**Figure 2. Alpha Rarefaction Curve (Observed Features)**
- Line Graph
- Shows alpha diversity plotted across sequencing depths
- Created with `qiime diversity alpha-rarefaction`
- Inputs:
  - `alpha-rarefraction.qzv`
- Confirms 2500 as a resonable sampling depth
